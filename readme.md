## ❓What is it?

This is my first year's project in the bachelor Creative Tech & AI.

The project had a few requirements:
1. Train and use a YOLOv8 object detection model.
2. Use a Raspberry Pi computer.

What I implemented:
1. YOLOv8 model trained on both mine and publicly available datasets.
2. SQLite database running on a Raspberry Pi to store the number of people in the room.
3. Streamlit app that lets the user visualize the data gathered by the model.
